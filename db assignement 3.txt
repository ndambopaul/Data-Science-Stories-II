SQL Assignment: Building a Simple College Database

Objective:
This assignment will help you practice creating databases, tables, and relationships, as well as inserting, updating, selecting, and deleting records.

Scenario:
You have been asked to create a simple database for a college. The database should store information about students, courses, and enrollments.


Instructions:

1. Create a database:
   - Create a database named `CollegeDB`.

2. Create three tables:
   - `Students`: This table will store student information.
   - `Courses`: This table will store course information.
   - `Enrollments`: This table will track which students are enrolled in which courses. The table should include references (foreign keys) to both the `Students` and `Courses` tables.

3. Table Details:

   - Students Table:
     - `student_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
     - `first_name` (VARCHAR(50))
     - `last_name` (VARCHAR(50))
     - `email` (VARCHAR(100))
   
   - Courses Table:
     - `course_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
     - `course_name` (VARCHAR(100))
     - `course_description` (TEXT)
   
   - Enrollments Table:
     - `enrollment_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
     - `student_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY references Students(student_id))
     - `course_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY references Courses(course_id))
     - `enrollment_date` (DATE)

Part 1: Database and Table Creation

- Write SQL queries to:
   1. Create the `CollegeDB` database.
   2. Create the `Students`, `Courses`, and `Enrollments` tables with the structure described above.


Part 2: Data Insertion

- Insert the following data into the tables:

   - Students:
     1. John Doe, johndoe@example.com
     2. Jane Smith, janesmith@example.com

   - Courses:
     1. Introduction to Databases
     2. Advanced SQL Techniques

   - Enrollments:
     1. John Doe is enrolled in "Introduction to Databases" on '2024-01-15'.
     2. Jane Smith is enrolled in "Advanced SQL Techniques" on '2024-01-16'.

Part 3: Querying Data

- Write SQL queries to:
   1. Select all students.
   2. Select all courses.
   3. Select all enrollments, showing the student’s name and course name (use a JOIN): IGNORE THIS.
   4. Select all students enrolled in "Introduction to Databases".

Part 4: Updating Records

- Write an SQL query to:
   1. Update the course name "Introduction to Databases" to "Database Fundamentals".
   2. Update John Doe’s email to `john.doe2024@example.com`.


Part 5: Deleting Records

- Write an SQL query to:
   1. Delete the course "Advanced SQL Techniques" from the `Courses` table.
   2. Remove Jane Smith’s enrollment in any course.
